This is a Thai version of the <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7819/jackson">Jackson font</a>. Jackson was shown in 1971 by dry-transfer manufacturer Mecanorma and credited to B. Jacquet [Mecanorma 1988]. Several sources give the full name as Bernard Jacquet [Reichardt/Hoefer]. I first saw Jackson on a <A href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/63594/beethoven-suit-bangkok">tailor shop in Bangkok</a>. It also included a custom made version of the sign in Thai. Since there was no Thai version of Jackson, I decided to create one.
